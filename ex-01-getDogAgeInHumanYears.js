/**
 * getDogAgeInHumanYears()
 *
 * To get a dog's age in relation to human-years,
 * you need to multiply the number of years the dog
 * has lived by 7
 *
 * For example, if your dog is 3 years old,
 * then in human-years, your dog is 21.
 *
 * Write a method called getDogAgeInHumanYears() that
 *  gets a dog object's `.age` property and returns
 *  the human-years
